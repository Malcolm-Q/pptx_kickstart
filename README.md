A simple script to generate a PowerPoint given a prompt using openai and python-pptx.

[View the Code](/powerpoint_kickstart.py)

# Description
Module I made for my friend to kickstart presentations on general topics. Produces a structured .pptx file with slide topics and context / ideas to talk about. Needs to be formatted further. Time to execute is ~15 seconds.

# Requirements
* Packages:
    * openai
    * python-pptx
* API Keys:
    * openai API key environment variable set to 'openai_key'

# Notes
This is not a wonder program to create a personalized beautiful presentation. It's a simple script to kickstart the process, relieve you of the tedious tasks that go into presentation creation, and help overcome writers block.

You can change the system prompt as you like, the api request has not been fine tuned to save API cost. Because of this it will sometimes generate powerpoints that have structure but a lack of notes.

# Examples
*Example structure for the start of a Powerpoint of why exercise is important.*
